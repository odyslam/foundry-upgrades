# foundry-upgrades
Helper smart contracts to deploy and manage upgradeable contracts on Ethereum, with Foundry.

This repository is a port of [OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades/tree/master/packages/plugin-hardhat/), aiming to showcase how the user can test upgradeable
contracts using a simple API in Solidity.

`ProxyTester.sol` is a master-key proxy, that the user can define and instantly spawn proxies for their test contracts.
